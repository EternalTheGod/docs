DiscordSRV is a very commonly used plugin that acts as a bridge between your Minecraft and Discord servers, allowing them to communicate and for actions to be called via interactions in Discord and vice-versa. DiscordSRV also supports livechat functionality between your Minecraft and Discord server so players that aren't logged in can still chat. Moreover, DiscordSRV allows for linking a users Discord account to their Minecraft account on a per-instance basis. That said, the setup of DiscordSRV relies on the creation of an application and Bot on Discord's Developer Portal.
