We want to be more than just an administration wiki which is why we're also starting to offer some first party services. 

### That's Hosted Over There

Starting off strong, we're pleased to announce the expansion of our 'UGC' (User Generated Content) platform and have migrated everything over to a standalone product called "That's Hosted Over There" (THOT for short).
