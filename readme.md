# Branch Archived

We're currently now working on V3, please move to the V3 branch for active commits.

## Welcome

This is setup.md, a single pane of glass for all your Minecraft server administration needs. The goal of this website is to collate as much useful information for novice server owners in one place as possible. We know that this site won't contain **everything** but our goal is to cover as much as we physically can.


If you need assistance with a topic we don't don't yet cover head on over to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pXaQgzneed) server where you can ask for assistance, suggest document additions / changes and bounce ideas of other server owners.


### Topic Breakdowns

We've attempted to break things down into a few core sections outlined below in order to make finding documentation easy.

#### Section 0 - Complete Guides

This first section consists only of complete guides which will run you through all the required steps from start to finish. Some documents within this area might be brief but they will contain links to additional pages to explain certain tasks within more detail.

To get started you can [click here](0-complete-guides/guide-list.md).

#### Section 1 - Deploying a Server

This section is for those who are starting from fresh. We cover topics such as identifying your tools, understanding the difference between a 'paper server' and a 'modded server' all the way through to picking the right hosting environment, deploying your server and troubleshooting common deployment errors you could come across.

#### Section 2 - Understanding Config Files

The next section is for those who are now up and running with a basic server but are looking to make adjustments to gameplay mechanics. This section includes a breakdown into he default files of a Minecraft server in addition to understanding 'YML' plugin configuration files.
