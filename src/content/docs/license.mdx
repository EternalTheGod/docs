Minecraft servers that operate for-profit are able to learn from and implement/follow tutorials and/or plugins/tools/services that we recommend, we do kindly ask that for-profit servers with revenue greater than 1000 USD per month make a one-off contribution for the sum of 50$ (in your server's name) to support the maintenance and up-keep of "The Wiki" allowing us to provide these resources at a near net-zero operating cost for the next generation.

If you're uncertain if your server meets these threshholds please reach out to us via Discord.
