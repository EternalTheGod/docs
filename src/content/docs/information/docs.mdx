This the the setup.md wiki, we've collated some of our most useful bits of information that anyone can use as a reference point for developing their Minecraft server. This wiki is primarily maintained by the wonderful Admincraft community, thou we thank external contributors who have added to our project.

We have attempted to cover all of the key areas when it comes to running a server, you can find these top level categories on the left hand side (minus guides which are walkthroughs for deployment).
